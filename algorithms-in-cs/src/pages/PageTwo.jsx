      response="Computer scientists use algorithms in many different ways.
       At the very beginning of the day to the end of the night, people follow
        a schedule or list of steps. This action of following a list of steps is
         a prime example of using an algorithm to get through the day. Additionally,
          outside of daily tasks, developers write algorithms for electronic computers
           to use and run programs on. These algorithms make it possible for applications
            like Google, Instagram, YouTube, and several others to process, store, and 
            retrieve data/inputs. Finally, with the development of technology over the years,
             artificial intelligence has been growing as a result. These algorithms can be used
              by developers to write and produce code more efficiently.
